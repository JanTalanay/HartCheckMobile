        High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a common medical condition that affects a
        significant number of individuals worldwide. It occurs when the force of blood against the walls
        of the arteries is consistently too high, putting extra strain on the heart and blood vessels.
        While high blood pressure can be influenced by genetic factors, lifestyle choices such as a
        sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet, excessive salt intake, smoking, and excessive alcohol
        consumption can contribute to its development.
